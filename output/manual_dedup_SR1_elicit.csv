Moreover, virtually all psychotherapeutic agents for schizophrenia target D2R in brain. Permanent D2RSS as a feature of a new animal model of schizophrenia was first reported in 1991, and then behaviorally and biochemically characterized over the next 15-20 years. In this model of schizophrenia characterized by production of D2RSS in ontogeny, there are demonstrated alterations of signaling processes, as well as functional links between the biologic template of the animal model and ability of pharmacotherapeutics to modulate or reverse biologic and behavioral modalities toward normality. Another such animal model, featuring knockout of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), demonstrates D2RSS with an increase in the proportion of D2R in the high-affinity state. Currently, TAAR1 agonists are being explored as a therapeutic option for schizophrenia. There is likewise an overlay of D2RSS with substance use disorder. The aspect of adenosine A(2A)-D-2 heteroreceptor complexes in substance use disorder is highlighted, and the association of adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists in discriminative and rewarding effects of psychostimulants is outlined. In summary, these new animal models of schizophrenia have face, construct, and predictive validity, and distinct advantages over earlier models. While the review summarizes elements of D2RSS in schizophrenia per se, and its interplay with substance use disorder, a major focus is on presumed new molecular targets attending D2RSS in schizophrenia and related clinical entities.",NA,NA,2018,2018,1,NA,"3",NA,NA,"519–526",NA,NA,"366",NA,"JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS","Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics",1,NA,NA,"0022-3565","10.1124/jpet.118.247981","10.1124/jpet.118.247981",1,"05f2e6c8-63c7-450d-855e-56ce57be3708","sr1_elicit_2","original_Tiab_exclude","elicit_exclude","original","elicit","05f2e6c8-63c7-450d-855e-56ce57be3708","sr1_elicit_2",FALSE,"05f2e6c8-63c7-450d-855e-56ce57be3708","sr1_elicit_2"

In particular, there is evidence suggesting that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) affects the dopaminergic system by regulating the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons or by altering dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) responsiveness to ligands. TAAR1 is a G alpha(s) protein-coupled receptor that is activated by biogenic amines, ``trace amines,{''} such as beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA) and tyramine that are normally found at low concentrations in the mammalian brain. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of interaction between TAAR1 and D2R and the role this interaction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated beta-PEA increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced. Taken together, these data suggest that TAAR1 and D2R have functional and physical interactions that could be critical for the modulation of the dopaminergic system by TAAR1 in vivo.",NA,NA,2011,2011,1,NA,"3",NA,NA,"416–425",NA,NA,"80",NA,"MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY","Molecular Pharmacology",1,NA,NA,"0026-895X","10.1124/mol.111.073304","10.1124/mol.111.073304",1,"285b3eb9-3d12-4ade-81ba-a2a98ab51dc1","sr1_elicit_5","original_Tiab_exclude","elicit_include","original","elicit","285b3eb9-3d12-4ade-81ba-a2a98ab51dc1","sr1_elicit_5",FALSE,"285b3eb9-3d12-4ade-81ba-a2a98ab51dc1","sr1_elicit_5"

Evidence against the involvement of presynaptic serotonergic mechanism.",0.899545169166376,"The effects of fenfluramine, an indirect serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonist, on sleep and brain indole- and catecholamines were examined in rats. Animals implanted with cerebrocortical and dorsal neck muscle electrodes were continuously monitored by the EEG for 12 hr after i.p. injections of dl-fenfluramine hydrochloride (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg). Fenfluramine produced a dose-dependent suppression of both slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS). Accompanying these effects was a dose-dependent increase in head-shaking, a behavior associated with activation of central 5-HT receptors. The incidence of head-shaking was inversely related to SWS and REMS time. At doses which significantly suppressed sleep (5 and 10 mg/kg), fenfluramine lowered whole brain 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations without affecting brain catecholamines. Pretreatment with metergoline (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg i.p.), a 5-HT receptor antagonist, 1 hr before the administration of fenfluramine (5 mg/kg) blocked the fenfluramine-induced suppression of SWS in a dose-dependent manner and prevented head-shaking behavior, but failed to prevent the suppression of REMS. In contrast, pretreatment with alpha-flupenthixol (0.2 mg/kg i.p.), a dopamine receptor antagonist, had no effect on the suppression of sleep and the stimulation of head-shaking behavior produced by fenfluramine. These data suggest that the suppression of SWS but not of REMS by fenfluramine is mediated by activation of the serotonergic system. The increase in serotonergic activity produced by fenfluramine may result from the drug-induced release of 5-HT with subsequent stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that pharmacological stimulation of 5-HT receptors suppresses sleep in the rat.","The present study investigated the involvement of presynaptic serotonergic mechanisms in the sleep suppressant action of fenfluramine, an indirect serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonist. Rats implanted with cerebrocortical and dorsal neck muscle electrodes were pretreated with either fluoxetine, an inhibitor of 5-HT uptake, or p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), an inhibitor of 5-HT synthesis. Animals were continuously monitored by the EEG for 12 hr after an i.p. injection of 5 mg/kg of dl-fenfluramine hydrochloride. Pretreatment with fluoxetine failed to antagonize the fenfluramine-induced suppression of slow-wave sleep and rapid-eye-movement sleep. However, chemical analyses showed that fluoxetine pretreatment completely prevented the depletion of brain 5-HT produced by fenfluramine, suggesting that fenfluramine did not gain entry into serotonergic neurons. Depletion of brain 5-HT by PCPA also failed to antagonize the sleep suppression caused by fenfluramine as well as that observed after administration of quipazine, a direct 5-HT receptor stimulant. Because administration of fenfluramine to PCPA-pretreated rats produced no additional depletion of 5-HT, it appears that 5-HT was no longer available for release by fenfluramine in these animals. Furthermore, neither pretreatment with fluoxetine nor PCPA antagonized the head-shaking induced by fenfluramine, a behavior associated with activation of central 5-HT receptors. These data indicate that the suppression of sleep produced by fenfluramine is not mediated through release of 5-HT as brain 5-HT concentrations were not related to the behavioral effects of the drug. The sleep suppressant action of fenfluramine may therefore result from a direct action of the drug on postsynaptic 5-HT receptors.",0.887521285322644,1983,1983,1,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,1,"The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,"444058fd-cdb9-4961-a0c5-7479065135b4","e08439f3-df14-4192-841a-e75a6c989d46","original_Tiab_exclude","original_Tiab_exclude","original","original","444058fd-cdb9-4961-a0c5-7479065135b4","e08439f3-df14-4192-841a-e75a6c989d46",FALSE,"444058fd-cdb9-4961-a0c5-7479065135b4","e08439f3-df14-4192-841a-e75a6c989d46"

Several trace amines such as Î²-phenylethylamine (Î²-PEA), p-tyramine and tryptamine are agonists at TA(1) but poorly activate rat and mouse Taar4. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Using rat TA(1) and Taar4 chimera, we identified determinants in transmembrane helices 3 and 6, which, when replaced by the corresponding portion of rat TA(1) , can rescue cell surface expression of rat Taar4. When expressed at the cell surface, rat Taar4 pharmacology was very similar to that of TA(1) and coupled to the GÎ±(s) -protein/AC pathway.

However, the subcellular distribution of TAAR1 is still unclear, since TAAR1 signal is largely intracellular. In vitro, TAAR1 is activated with nanomolar to micromolar affinity by some endogenous amines, particularly p-tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine, and 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), the latter representing a novel branch of thyroid hormone signaling. In addition, TAAR1 responds to a number of psychoactive drugs, i.e., amphetamines, ergoline derivatives, bromocriptine and lisuride. Trace amines have been identified as neurotransmitters in invertebrates, and they are considered as potential neuromodulators. In particular, beta-phenylethylamine and p-tyramine have been reported to modify the release and/or the response to dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and GABA, while evidence of cross-talk between TAAR1 and other aminergic receptors has been provided. Systemic or intracerebroventricular injection of exogenous T1AM produced prolearning and antiamnestic effects, reduced pain threshold, decreased non-REM sleep, and modulated the firing rate of adrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus. However each of these substances may have additional molecular targets, and it is unclear whether their endogenous levels are sufficient to produce significant TAAR1 activation in vivo. TAAR1 knock out mice show a worse performance in anxiety and working memory tests, and they are more prone to develop ethanol addiction. They also show increased locomotor response to amphetamine, and decreased stereotypical responses induced by apomorphine. Notably, human genes for TAARs cluster on chromosome 6 at q23, within a region whose mutations have been reported to confer susceptibility to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. For human TAAR1, around 200 non-synonymous and 400 synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified, but their functional consequences have not been extensively investigated yet. In conclusion, the bulk of evidence points to a significant physiological role of TAAR1 in the modulation of central nervous system function and a potential pharmacological role of TAAR1 agonists in neurology and/or psychiatry. However, the specific effects of TAAR1 stimulation are still controversial, and many crucial issues require further investigation.",NA,NA,2018,2018,1,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,1,"FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY","Frontiers in Pharmacology",1,0,NA,NA,"10.3389/fphar.2017.00987","10.3389/fphar.2017.00987",1,"5caa01e8-f8a7-41d1-b101-5376c0fadd46","sr1_elicit_13","original_Tiab_exclude","elicit_exclude","original","elicit","5caa01e8-f8a7-41d1-b101-5376c0fadd46","sr1_elicit_13",FALSE,"5caa01e8-f8a7-41d1-b101-5376c0fadd46","sr1_elicit_13"

Recent studies have suggested that positive allosteric modulation of the M(1) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) may provide a novel means of improving cognition. However, very little is known about the potential of combination therapies in extending coverage across schizophrenic symptom domains. This study investigated the effect of the M(1) mAChR positive allosteric modulator BQCA [1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid], alone or in combination with haloperidol (a first-generation antipsychotic), clozapine (a second-generation atypical antipsychotic), or aripiprazole (a third-generation atypical antipsychotic), in reversing deficits in sensorimotor gating and spatial memory induced by the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, MK-801 [(5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine]. Sensorimotor gating and spatial memory induction are two models that represent aspects of schizophrenia modeled in rodents. In prepulse inhibition (an operational measure of sensorimotor gating), BQCA alone had minimal effects but exhibited different levels of efficacy in reversing MK-801-induced prepulse inhibition disruptions when combined with a subeffective dose of each of the three (currently prescribed) antipsychotics. Furthermore, the combined effect of BQCA and clozapine was absent in M(1)(-/-) mice. Interestingly, although BQCA alone had no effect in reversing MK-801-induced memory impairments in a Y-maze spatial test, we observed a reversal upon the combination of BQCA with atypical antipsychotics, but not with haloperidol. These findings provide proof of concept that a judicious combination of existing antipsychotics with a selective M(1) mAChR positive allosteric modulator can extend antipsychotic efficacy in glutamatergic deficit models of behavior.",NA,NA,2016,2016,1,NA,"2",NA,NA,"354–365",NA,NA,"359",NA,"The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics",0.838243407260289,NA,NA,"0022-3565","10.1124/jpet.116.235788","10.1124/jpet.116.235788",1,"66768be7-f8ba-4d5e-9070-1e207edc442c","sr1_elicit_218","original_Tiab_exclude","elicit_exclude","original","elicit","66768be7-f8ba-4d5e-9070-1e207edc442c","sr1_elicit_218",FALSE,"66768be7-f8ba-4d5e-9070-1e207edc442c","sr1_elicit_218"

Concomitant ingestion of these foodstuffs with monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in the hypertensive crisis known as the ``beer, wine, and cheese effect{'' attributed to their sympathomimetic action. Trace amines have been shown to act on one of a novel group of mammalian seven transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptors belonging to the rhodopsin superfamily, cloned in 2001. This receptor encoded by the human TAAR1 gene is also present in rat and mouse genomes (Taar1) and has been shown to be activated by endogenous trace amine ligands, including p-tyramine and beta-phenylethylamine. A number of drugs, most notably amphetamine and its derivatives, act as agonists at this receptor. This review proposes an official nomenclature designating TAAR1 as the trace amine 1 receptor following the convention of naming receptors after the endogenous agonist, abbreviated to TA(1) where necessary. It goes on to discuss briefly the significance of the receptor, agents acting upon it, its distribution, and currently hypothesized physiological and pathophysiological roles. In humans, a further five genes are thought to encode functional receptors (TAAR2, TAAR5, TAAR6, TAAR8, and TAAR9). TAAR3 seems to be a pseudogene in some individuals but not others. TAAR4 is a pseudogene in humans, but occurs with TAAR3 as a functional gene in rodents. Nine further genes are present in rats and mice.

The mechanisms underlying SCB-elicited pro-psychotic effects is unknown, but given the ubiquitous neuromodulatory functions of the endocannabinoid system, it seems likely that agonist actions at cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs) might modulate the functions of other neurotransmitter systems known to be involved in schizophrenia. The present review surveys what is currently known about the interactions of CB1Rs with dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate systems, because all three of those neurotransmitters are well-established in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and psychosis. Identification of molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-psychotic effects of SCB drugs of abuse may establish certain classes of these substances as particularly dangerous, guiding regulations to control availability of these drugs.

However, endogenous TAAR6 agonists and the receptor signaling profile and brain distribution remain unclear. Here, we clone TAAR6 from the rhesus monkey and use transfected cells to investigate whether this receptor interacts with brain monoamines and a psychostimulant drug to trigger cAMP signaling or extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, while investigating its expression profile in the rhesus monkey brain. Unlike TAAR1, rhesus monkey TAAR6 did not alter cAMP levels in response to 10 μM of monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, β‐phenylethylamine (β‐PEA), octopamine, tryptamine, and tyramine) or methamphetamine in stably transfected cells in vitro. Real‐time cell electronic sensing analysis indicated that the receptor did not alter cell impedance or change the effect of forskolin on cell impedance at exposure to 20 μM of each monoamine, suggesting a lack of either Gs or Gi‐linked signaling. Whereas κ opioid receptor activation led to ERK phosphorylation at exposure to 1 μM U69593, rhesus monkey TAAR6 had no such effect at exposure to 10 μM of monoamines or methamphetamine. Membrane and cell surface localization of TAAR6 was confirmed by immunocytochemistry, biotinylation, and Western blot testing with a TAAR6 antibody in the transfected cells. Real‐time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction amplification showed that TAAR6 mRNA was undetectable in selected rhesus monkey brain regions. Together, the data reveal that TAAR6 is unresponsive to brain monoamines and is not expressed in rhesus monkey brain monoaminergic nuclei, suggesting TAAR6 lacks direct association with brain monoaminergic neuronal function. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","SEVERAL RECENT STUDIES REPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 6 (TAAR6) AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SCHIZOPHRENIA AND BIPOLAR AFFECTIVE DISORDER IN HUMANS.
