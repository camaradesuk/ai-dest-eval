Moreover, virtually all psychotherapeutic agents for schizophrenia target D2R in brain. Permanent D2RSS as a feature of a new animal model of schizophrenia was first reported in 1991, and then behaviorally and biochemically characterized over the next 15-20 years. In this model of schizophrenia characterized by production of D2RSS in ontogeny, there are demonstrated alterations of signaling processes, as well as functional links between the biologic template of the animal model and ability of pharmacotherapeutics to modulate or reverse biologic and behavioral modalities toward normality. Another such animal model, featuring knockout of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), demonstrates D2RSS with an increase in the proportion of D2R in the high-affinity state. Currently, TAAR1 agonists are being explored as a therapeutic option for schizophrenia. There is likewise an overlay of D2RSS with substance use disorder. The aspect of adenosine A(2A)-D-2 heteroreceptor complexes in substance use disorder is highlighted, and the association of adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists in discriminative and rewarding effects of psychostimulants is outlined. In summary, these new animal models of schizophrenia have face, construct, and predictive validity, and distinct advantages over earlier models. While the review summarizes elements of D2RSS in schizophrenia per se, and its interplay with substance use disorder, a major focus is on presumed new molecular targets attending D2RSS in schizophrenia and related clinical entities.","0022-3565","original_Tiab_exclude, elicit_exclude","original, elicit","05f2e6c8-63c7-450d-855e-56ce57be3708, sr1_elicit_2"

However, the precise functional roles of TAAR1 to the actions of clinically used antidepressants remains unclear. Herein, we addressed these issues employing the TAAR1 agonist, o-phenyl-iodotyramine (o-PIT), together with TAAR1-knockout (KO) mice. Irrespective of genotype, systemic administration of o-PIT led to a similar increase in mouse brain concentrations. Consistent with the observation of a high density of TAAR1 in the medial preoptic area, o-PIT-induced hypothermia was significantly reduced in TAAR1-KO mice. Furthermore, the inhibition of a prepulse inhibition response by o-PIT, as well as its induction of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation and elevation of extracellular DA in prefrontal cortex, were all reduced in TAAR1-KO compared to wildtype mice. O-PIT was active in both forced-swim and marble-burying tests, and its effects were significantly blunted in TAAR1-KO mice. Conversely, the actions on behaviour and prefrontal cortex dialysis of a broad suite of clinically used antidepressants were unaffected in TAAR1-KO mice. In conclusion, o-PIT is a useful tool for exploring the hypothermic and other functional antidepressant roles of TAAR1. By contrast, clinically used antidepressants do not require TAAR1 for expression of their antidepressant properties.","1422-0067","original_Tiab_exclude, elicit_include","original, elicit","27fc059f-73c1-4c23-9505-fcc1e2d992f7, sr1_elicit_134"

In particular, there is evidence suggesting that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) affects the dopaminergic system by regulating the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons or by altering dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) responsiveness to ligands. TAAR1 is a G alpha(s) protein-coupled receptor that is activated by biogenic amines, ``trace amines,{''} such as beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA) and tyramine that are normally found at low concentrations in the mammalian brain. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of interaction between TAAR1 and D2R and the role this interaction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated beta-PEA increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced. Taken together, these data suggest that TAAR1 and D2R have functional and physical interactions that could be critical for the modulation of the dopaminergic system by TAAR1 in vivo.","0026-895X","original_Tiab_exclude, elicit_include","original, elicit","285b3eb9-3d12-4ade-81ba-a2a98ab51dc1, sr1_elicit_5"

PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Using rat TA(1) and Taar4 chimera, we identified determinants in transmembrane helices 3 and 6, which, when replaced by the corresponding portion of rat TA(1) , can rescue cell surface expression of rat Taar4. When expressed at the cell surface, rat Taar4 pharmacology was very similar to that of TA(1) and coupled to the GÎ±(s) -protein/AC pathway. Our data suggest that binding pockets of Taar for surrogate agonists overlap between paralogs.

However, the subcellular distribution of TAAR1 is still unclear, since TAAR1 signal is largely intracellular. In vitro, TAAR1 is activated with nanomolar to micromolar affinity by some endogenous amines, particularly p-tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine, and 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), the latter representing a novel branch of thyroid hormone signaling. In addition, TAAR1 responds to a number of psychoactive drugs, i.e., amphetamines, ergoline derivatives, bromocriptine and lisuride. Trace amines have been identified as neurotransmitters in invertebrates, and they are considered as potential neuromodulators. In particular, beta-phenylethylamine and p-tyramine have been reported to modify the release and/or the response to dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and GABA, while evidence of cross-talk between TAAR1 and other aminergic receptors has been provided. Systemic or intracerebroventricular injection of exogenous T1AM produced prolearning and antiamnestic effects, reduced pain threshold, decreased non-REM sleep, and modulated the firing rate of adrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus. However each of these substances may have additional molecular targets, and it is unclear whether their endogenous levels are sufficient to produce significant TAAR1 activation in vivo. TAAR1 knock out mice show a worse performance in anxiety and working memory tests, and they are more prone to develop ethanol addiction. They also show increased locomotor response to amphetamine, and decreased stereotypical responses induced by apomorphine. Notably, human genes for TAARs cluster on chromosome 6 at q23, within a region whose mutations have been reported to confer susceptibility to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. For human TAAR1, around 200 non-synonymous and 400 synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified, but their functional consequences have not been extensively investigated yet. In conclusion, the bulk of evidence points to a significant physiological role of TAAR1 in the modulation of central nervous system function and a potential pharmacological role of TAAR1 agonists in neurology and/or psychiatry. However, the specific effects of TAAR1 stimulation are still controversial, and many crucial issues require further investigation.",NA,"original_Tiab_exclude, elicit_exclude","original, elicit","5caa01e8-f8a7-41d1-b101-5376c0fadd46, sr1_elicit_13"

Recent studies have suggested that positive allosteric modulation of the M(1) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) may provide a novel means of improving cognition. However, very little is known about the potential of combination therapies in extending coverage across schizophrenic symptom domains. This study investigated the effect of the M(1) mAChR positive allosteric modulator BQCA [1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid], alone or in combination with haloperidol (a first-generation antipsychotic), clozapine (a second-generation atypical antipsychotic), or aripiprazole (a third-generation atypical antipsychotic), in reversing deficits in sensorimotor gating and spatial memory induced by the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, MK-801 [(5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine]. Sensorimotor gating and spatial memory induction are two models that represent aspects of schizophrenia modeled in rodents. In prepulse inhibition (an operational measure of sensorimotor gating), BQCA alone had minimal effects but exhibited different levels of efficacy in reversing MK-801-induced prepulse inhibition disruptions when combined with a subeffective dose of each of the three (currently prescribed) antipsychotics. Furthermore, the combined effect of BQCA and clozapine was absent in M(1)(-/-) mice. Interestingly, although BQCA alone had no effect in reversing MK-801-induced memory impairments in a Y-maze spatial test, we observed a reversal upon the combination of BQCA with atypical antipsychotics, but not with haloperidol. These findings provide proof of concept that a judicious combination of existing antipsychotics with a selective M(1) mAChR positive allosteric modulator can extend antipsychotic efficacy in glutamatergic deficit models of behavior.","0022-3565","original_Tiab_exclude, elicit_exclude","original, elicit","66768be7-f8ba-4d5e-9070-1e207edc442c, sr1_elicit_218"

However, the mechanism by which this occurs has not been clarified. Previous studies found that dopamine-deficient (DD) mice exhibited hyperactivity in a novel environment. This hyperactivity is improved by clozapine and donepezil, which are used to treat psychiatric symptoms associated with dopamine deficiency (PSDD). We considered that DD mice could be used to study PSDD. In the present study, we sought to identify the pharmacological mechanism of PSDD. We conducted locomotor activity tests by administering quetiapine and drugs that have specific actions on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) receptors and muscarinic receptors. Changes in neuronal activity that were induced by drug administration in DD mice were evaluated by examining Fos immunoreactivity. Quetiapine suppressed hyperactivity in DD mice while the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100635 inhibited this effect. The number of Fos-positive neurons in the median raphe nucleus increased in DD mice that exhibited hyperactivity and was decreased by treatment with quetiapine and 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists. In conclusion, hyperactivity in DD mice was ameliorated by quetiapine, likely through 5-HT(1A) receptor activation. These findings suggest that 5-HT(1A) receptors may play a role in PSDD, and 5-HT(1A) receptor-targeting drugs may help improve PSDD.","1422-0067","original_Tiab_exclude, elicit_exclude","original, elicit","8ca26c6c-012d-4a19-8402-3937ec5c5eac, sr1_elicit_354"

Considering the well-described sex differences in schizophrenia, we investigated whether sex affects MIA impact on dopamine system and on schizophrenia-related behavioral phenotype. Furthermore, considering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î± (PPARÎ±) expression in the CNS as well as its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, we tested if PPARÎ± activation by prenatal treatment with a clinically available fibrate (fenofibrate) may mitigate MIA-related effects. METHODS: We induced MIA in rat dams with polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (Poly I:C) and assessed prepulse inhibition and dopamine neuron activity in the VTA by means of electrophysiological recordings in male and female preweaned and adult offspring. RESULTS: Poly I:C-treated males displayed prepulse inhibition deficits, reduced number and firing rate of VTA dopamine neurons, and paired-pulse facilitation of inhibitory and excitatory synapses. Prenatal fenofibrate administration attenuated detrimental effects induced by MIA on both the schizophrenia-like behavioral phenotype and dopamine transmission in male offspring. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms previous evidence that females are less susceptible to MIA and highlights PPARÎ± as a potential target for treatments in schizophrenia.","1755-5949","original_Tiab_exclude, elicit_exclude","original, elicit","98801ce0-6937-4390-a743-7eeb25c53cd3, sr1_elicit_127"

However, no selective ligand to identify TAAR1-specific signaling mechanisms is available yet. Here we report a selective TAAR1 antagonist, EPPTB, and characterize its physiological effects at dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We show that EPPTB prevents the reduction of the firing frequency of DA neurons induced by p-tyramine (p-tyr), a nonselective TAAR1 agonist. When applied alone, EPPTB increases the firing frequency of DA neurons, suggesting that TAAR1 either exhibits constitutive activity or is tonically activated by ambient levels of endogenous agonist(s). We further show that EPPTB blocks the TAAR1-mediated activation of an inwardly rectifying K+ current. When applied alone, EPPTB induces an apparent inward current, suggesting the closure of tonically activated K+ channels. Importantly, these EPPTB effects were absent in Taar1 knockout mice, ruling out off-target effects. We additionally found that both the acute application of EPPTB and the constitutive genetic lack of TAAR1 increase the potency of DA at D2 receptors in DA neurons. In summary, our data support that TAAR1 tonically activates inwardly rectifying K+ channels, which reduces the basal firing frequency of DA neurons in the VTA. We hypothesize that the EPPTB-induced increase in the potency of DA at D2 receptors is part of a homeostatic feedback mechanism compensating for the lack of inhibitory TAAR1 tone.","1091-6490","original_Tiab_exclude, elicit_exclude","original, elicit","a55aed21-c2a8-4dd2-be0d-a67c508fe227, sr1_elicit_18"

Concomitant ingestion of these foodstuffs with monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in the hypertensive crisis known as the ``beer, wine, and cheese effect{'' attributed to their sympathomimetic action. Trace amines have been shown to act on one of a novel group of mammalian seven transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptors belonging to the rhodopsin superfamily, cloned in 2001. This receptor encoded by the human TAAR1 gene is also present in rat and mouse genomes (Taar1) and has been shown to be activated by endogenous trace amine ligands, including p-tyramine and beta-phenylethylamine. A number of drugs, most notably amphetamine and its derivatives, act as agonists at this receptor. This review proposes an official nomenclature designating TAAR1 as the trace amine 1 receptor following the convention of naming receptors after the endogenous agonist, abbreviated to TA(1) where necessary. It goes on to discuss briefly the significance of the receptor, agents acting upon it, its distribution, and currently hypothesized physiological and pathophysiological roles. In humans, a further five genes are thought to encode functional receptors (TAAR2, TAAR5, TAAR6, TAAR8, and TAAR9). TAAR3 seems to be a pseudogene in some individuals but not others. TAAR4 is a pseudogene in humans, but occurs with TAAR3 as a functional gene in rodents. Nine further genes are present in rats and mice. The endogenous ligands are not firmly established but some may respond to odorants consistent with their expression in olfactory epithelium.","0031-6997","original_Tiab_exclude, elicit_exclude","original, elicit","bf4e19c3-3479-4daf-ba2c-e683093f2203, sr1_elicit_36"

The mechanisms underlying SCB-elicited pro-psychotic effects is unknown, but given the ubiquitous neuromodulatory functions of the endocannabinoid system, it seems likely that agonist actions at cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs) might modulate the functions of other neurotransmitter systems known to be involved in schizophrenia. The present review surveys what is currently known about the interactions of CB1Rs with dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate systems, because all three of those neurotransmitters are well-established in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and psychosis. Identification of molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-psychotic effects of SCB drugs of abuse may establish certain classes of these substances as particularly dangerous, guiding regulations to control availability of these drugs. Likewise, an understanding of the pharmacological interactions which lead to schizophrenia and psychosis subsequent to SCB exposure might guide the development of novel therapies to treat afflicted users.","1097-9883","original_Tiab_exclude, elicit_exclude","original, elicit","d9e2c975-2384-4b3b-ac59-b400aee90013, sr1_elicit_7"

Currently, there are no defined therapeutic protocols to manage psychosis in TLE patients, as antipsychotic agents may induce epileptic seizures and are associated with severe side effects and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with antiepileptic drugs. Thus, novel treatment strategies are necessary. Several lines of evidence suggest that hippocampal hyperactivity is central to the pathology of both TLE and psychosis; therefore, restoring hippocampal activity back to normal levels may be a novel therapeutic approach for treating psychosis in TLE. In rodent models, increased activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) results in aberrant dopamine system function, which is thought to underlie symptoms of psychosis. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that targeting Î±5-containing Î³-aminobutyric acid receptors (Î±5GABA(A)Rs), an inhibitory receptor abundant in the hippocampus, with positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), can restore dopamine system function in rodent models displaying hippocampal hyperactivity. Thus, we posited that Î±5-PAMs may be beneficial in a model used to study TLE. Here, we demonstrate that pilocarpine-induced TLE is associated with increased VTA dopamine neuron activity, an effect that was completely reversed by intra-vHipp administration of GL-II-73, a selective Î±5-PAM. Further, pilocarpine did not alter the hippocampal Î±5GABA(A)R expression or synaptic localization that may affect the efficacy of Î±5-PAMs. Taken together, these results suggest augmenting Î±5GABA(A)R function as a novel therapeutic modality for the treatment of psychosis in TLE.","1422-0067","original_Tiab_exclude, elicit_exclude","original, elicit","f388e919-813e-4a83-b1b8-abec52dbc947, sr1_elicit_219"

It is indeed used as a pharmacological model of psychosis in preclinical research. The goal of this review was to understand the mechanism of action of psychotic-like effects of LSD. We searched Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar and articles’ reference lists for preclinical studies regarding the mechanism of action involved in the psychotic-like effects induced by LSD. LSD’s mechanism of action is pleiotropic, primarily mediated by the serotonergic system in the Dorsal Raphe, binding the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist and 5-HT1A as an agonist. LSD also modulates the Ventral Tegmental Area, at higher doses, by stimulating dopamine D2, Trace Amine Associate receptor 1 (TAAR1) and 5-HT2A. More studies clarifying the mechanism of action of the psychotic-like symptoms or psychosis induced by LSD in humans are needed. LSD’s effects are mediated by a pleiotropic mechanism involving serotonergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission. Thus, the LSD-induced psychosis is a useful model to test the therapeutic efficacy of potential novel antipsychotic drugs, particularly drugs with dual serotonergic and dopaminergic (DA) mechanism or acting on TAAR1 receptors.","1422-0067","elicit_exclude, original_Tiab_exclude","elicit, original","sr1_elicit_10, 0ad76285-eebf-42d0-bded-a07518e3e095"

Given the limitations of existing antipsychotics, there is urgent need for novel drugs with fewer side effects. SEP-363856 (SEP-856) is a novel psychotropic agent currently under phase III clinical investigation for schizophrenia treatment. In this study, we investigated the ability of an acute oral SEP-856 administration to modulate the functional activity of specific brain regions at basal levels and under glutamatergic or dopaminergic-perturbed conditions in adult rats. We found that immediate-early genes (IEGs) expression was strongly upregulated in the prefrontal cortex and, to a less extent, in the ventral hippocampus, suggesting an activation of these regions. Furthermore, SEP-856 was effective in preventing the hyperactivity induced by an acute injection of phencyclidine (PCP), but not of d-amphetamine (AMPH). The compound effectively normalized the PCP-induced increase in IEGs expression in the PFC at all doses tested, whereas only the highest dose determined the major modulations on AMPH-induced changes. Lastly, SEP-856 acute administration corrected the cognitive deficits produced by subchronic PCP administration. Taken together, our data provide further insights on SEP-856, suggesting that modulation of the PFC may represent an important mechanism for the functional and behavioural activity of this novel compound.","1422-0067","elicit_include, original_ft_include","elicit, original","sr1_elicit_136, 84b83472-4096-45e7-bdb4-bccd507fb1e0"

To decipher the brain functions of TAAR1, a selective TAAR1 agonist, RO5166017, was engineered. RO5166017 showed high affinity and potent functional activity at mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human TAAR1 stably expressed in HEK293 cells as well as high selectivity vs. other targets. In mouse brain slices, RO5166017 inhibited the firing frequency of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in regions where\\n                    Taar1\\n                    is expressed (i.e., the ventral tegmental area and dorsal raphe nucleus, respectively).

Thus, it is not surprising that considerable research has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms involved in the antipsychotic action of these compounds. It is important to note that the majority of these studies have been performed in ""normal"" experimental animals. Given that these animals do not possess the aberrant neuronal information processing typically associated with schizophrenia, the aim of the current study was to examine the dopamine D2 receptor system in a rodent model of schizophrenia. Here, we demonstrate that methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM)-treated rats display an enhanced effect of quinpirole on dopamine neuron activity and an aberrant locomotor response to D2-like receptor activation, suggesting changes in postsynaptic D2-like receptor function. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the enhanced response to D2-like ligands in MAM-treated rats, we examined the expression of D2, D3, and dopamine transporter mRNA in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. MAM-treated rats displayed a significant increase in dopamine D3 receptor mRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens with no significant changes in the expression of the D2 receptor. Taken together, these data demonstrate robust alterations in dopamine D2-like receptor function in a rodent model of schizophrenia and provide evidence that preclinical studies examining the mechanisms of antipsychotic drug action should be performed in animal models that mirror aspects of the abnormal neuronal transmission thought to underlie symptoms of schizophrenia.","0022-3565","elicit_include, original_Tiab_exclude","elicit, original","sr1_elicit_178, 41dd461f-345b-4cd5-af80-8cb73413decc"

In particular, agonist compounds have generated interest as potential treatments for schizophrenia and other psychoses due to TAAR1-mediated regulation of dopaminergic tone. Here, we review unmet needs in schizophrenia, the current state of knowledge in TAAR1 circuit biology and neuropharmacology, including preclinical behavioral, imaging, and cellular evidence in glutamatergic, dopaminergic and genetic models linked to the pathophysiology of psychotic, negative and cognitive symptoms. Clinical trial data for TAAR1 drug candidates are reviewed and contrasted with antipsychotics. The identification of endogenous TAAR1 ligands and subsequent development of small-molecule agonists has revealed antipsychotic-, anxiolytic-, and antidepressant-like properties, as well as pro-cognitive and REM-sleep suppressing effects of TAAR1 activation in rodents and non-human primates. Ulotaront, the first TAAR1 agonist to progress to randomized controlled clinical trials, has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia, while another, ralmitaront, is currently being evaluated in clinical trials in schizophrenia. Coupled with the preclinical findings, this provides a rationale for further investigation and development of this new pharmacological class for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.","1422-0067","elicit_exclude, original_Tiab_exclude","elicit, original","sr1_elicit_23, 47725041-feb1-45c8-8295-753bbe03ee82"

In this study, TAAR1 knockout mice and WT groups were tested in conditions of a high-fructose diet. The consumption of a high-fructose diet may be due to the influence on the metabolism processes by dopamine in the brain, neuromotor function, and level of anxiety of TAAR1 knockout mice. During a comparative analysis of behavioral, biochemical, and morphological parameters, significant differences were found between liver and biochemical parameters, the regulation of protein metabolism (AST/ALT ratio, creatine kinase activity, urea), and alterations in behavior. An elevated plus maze analysis showed the influence of fructose and genetic factors on the level of anxiety. A new marker of the grooming microstructure (depression ratio) was tested, which showed high efficiency as a marker of depression-like behavioral changes and a possible association with dopamine-dependent regulation of protein metabolism. These results confirm a possible association of the TAAR1 gene knockout with an increase in catabolic reaction levels by AST/ALT-dependent and possible dopamine-mediated protein metabolism regulation and depression-like behavior.","2035-8377","elicit_exclude, original_Tiab_exclude","elicit, original","sr1_elicit_418, 4f94a131-ea76-4275-bed4-616d464dcb23"
