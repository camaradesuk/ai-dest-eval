While they mention ""behavioral and biochemical responses,"" the experimental design isn't explicitly detailed, so there is uncertainty about whether proper controls were used.",maybe,"The abstract doesn't explicitly mention using animal models of psychosis or methods to induce psychosis-like features. While it discusses the dopaminergic system and antipsychotic effects, it doesn't clearly describe a psychosis model induction.",no,"The study focuses on D2R signaling and antipsychotics (haloperidol, clozapine, aripiprazole), but does not investigate TAAR1 agonists. This is a critical mismatch with the inclusion criteria, as the study examines different molecular pathways.",maybe,"The abstract doesn't explicitly mention the required co-primary outcomes (locomotor activity and PPI). While it mentions ""behavioral responses,"" these aren't specified as the required measures.",maybe,"While the study mentions comparing different antipsychotics, it doesn't clearly describe the control conditions specified in the criteria (vehicle controls or current antipsychotics as controls).",yes,"This is an original experimental study using animal models, so it meets this criterion.",Exclude,"The study focuses on D2R signaling mechanisms in antipsychotic action, which fundamentally differs from the systematic review's criteria of investigating TAAR1 agonists in psychosis models. Critical misalignments include the absence of TAAR1 agonist interventions, lack of clear psychosis model induction, and missing specified primary outcome measures. While an original experimental study using animal models, the research does not meet the essential screening requirements.",1.4

The studies focus more on cannabis exposure effects rather than induced psychosis models.",no,The studies do not investigate TAAR1 agonists. The interventions described are primarily THC (cannabis) exposure and its effects on dopamine transmission and other neurological measures. This clearly fails to meet the criterion for TAAR1 agonist interventions.,no,"The outcomes measured don't align with the required co-primary outcomes. While behavioral measures are included, they don't specifically focus on locomotor activity or PPI of the acoustic startle reflex. The outcomes described are more focused on dopamine transmission, working memory, and paranoia/hallucinations.",no,"While control groups are mentioned in some studies, they don't match the specific control conditions required (vehicle controls or current antipsychotics in psychosis models). The controls appear to be more general experimental controls.",no,"While some original experimental work is included, this appears to be a collection of research presentations rather than a single original experimental study.",Exclude,"The research presentations focus on cannabis use, THC exposure, and neurological effects, but do not meet the specific screening criteria for TAAR1 agonist studies in animal models of psychosis. Critical deviations include the absence of TAAR1 agonist interventions, lack of induced psychosis models, and different outcome measures than those specified in the screening requirements. Consequently, the research does not align with the predefined inclusion criteria.",0.1
